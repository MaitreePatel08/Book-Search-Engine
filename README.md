## Description

The GraphQL API has emerged as a framework that allows clients to make flexible/customizable requests that return just the data needed for the purposes of the app, preventing the frequent and computationally costly  fetching of data associated with certain implementations of REST APIs. In the case of full-stack apps that use React on the front-end, that means that we can take full advantage of client-side routing and the efficient rendering of data-driven components that conform the UI. Hence, we decided to refactor a simple full-stack React app to employ this query language both on the server and the client sides by using the Apollo platform together with the GraphQL package. In addition, we keep using Express servers running in a Node environment and store our user data in a MongoDB database. All read and write operations (corresponding to the queries and mutations of GraphQL) are achieved through the use of the Object Document Mapping (ODM) afforded by Mongoose. That way we keep practicing the so-called MERN stack while practicing a separation of concerns reminiscent of the one we learned when using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture together with RESTful routes. As a bonus, we get to do other things such as: authentication by means of JSON Web Tokens;
storing data on the client-side using the localStorage API; and using the Fetch API to make requests to the server-side Google Books API.
